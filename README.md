- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @acaciaaphylla
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the Australian library industry 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m an absolute beginner, currently learning how to use GitHub and figuring out what all this jargon means! 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: well, I'm still trying to think of a good one so watch this space (library staff find "interesting" things difficult)
